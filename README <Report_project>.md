Note: I cannot upload gradle directory (it's too big). However, there are all file in my app's back-end except only the gradle.

I am about to finish with back-end. I uesd TF-IDF with cosine similarity to match a sender with a receiver via sender's message and receiver's 
previous messages and interests. 

Right now, i have problems connecting my code with MogoDB. TBH, it's kinda my first time back-end coding (front-end too). Actually, I didnâ€™t have 
any coding as a job before.
